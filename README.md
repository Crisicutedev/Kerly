## üß™ Analysis Process

### 1. **Data Import and Cleaning**
- Loaded the dataset and converted date strings to datetime format.
- Detected null values; two rows were missing salesperson names.

### 2. **General Exploration**
- Checked the number of records by category and salesperson.
- Explored the distribution of sales values (`TOTAL`).

### 3. **Generated Visualizations**
- **Stripplots** to visualize sales distribution by `CATEGORIA` and `VENDEDOR`.
- **Time-based scatterplot** to view sales trends over time (`FECHA`).
- **Correlation heatmap** (only one main numeric variable available).
- **Barplot** showing average sales by category to highlight top performers.

### 4. **Monthly Analysis**
- Extracted month from `FECHA` to compare historical performance in May and identify opportunities.
